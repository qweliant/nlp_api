foucault,I don’t feel that it is necessary to know exactly what I am. The main interest in life and work is to become someone else that you were not in the beginning. If you knew when you began a book what you would say at the end do you think that you would have the courage to write it? What is true for writing and for love relationships is true also for life. The game is worthwhile insofar as we don’t know where it will end.
gyyatri, In this era of global capital triumphant to keep responsibility alive in the reading and teaching of the textual is at first sight impractical. It is however the right of the textual to be so responsible responsive answerable. The “planet” is here as perhaps always a catachresis for inscribing collective responsibility as right. Its alterity determining experience is mysterious and discontinuous—an experience of the impossible. It is such collectivities that must be opened up with the question “How many are we?” when cultural origin is detranscendentalized into fiction—the toughest task in the diaspora.
twain,  It is a quite natural opinion—indeed an inevitable opinion—but you did not create the materials out of which it is formed. They are odds and ends of thoughts impressions feelings gathered unconsciously from a thousand books a thousand conversations and from streams of thought and feeling which have flowed down into your heart and brain out of the hearts and brains of centuries of ancestors. Personally you did not create even the smallest microscopic fragment of the materials out of which your opinion is made; and personally you cannot claim even the slender merit of putting the borrowed materials together. That was done automatically—by your mental machinery in strict accordance with the law of that machinery's construction. And you not only did not make that machinery yourself but you have not even any command over it.
butler, Bound to seek recognition of its own existence in categories terms and names that are not of its own making the subject seeks the sign of its own existence outside itself in a discourse that is at once dominant and indifferent. Social categories signify subordination and existence at once. In other words within subjection the price of existence is subordination
